RustSoda -- Rust Stackoverflow Detector 
# RustSoda -- Rust Stack Overflow Detector 

**Thank you for noticing our tool!**

This tool is designed to find the stackoverflow vulnerabilty in Rust crates.
It can find all **recursive functions** in one crate, including those complicate **cross-function recursive calls**. e.g.

```
1. b()->c()->b()
2. a()->b()->c()->d()->a()
These two recursive functions share two same functions: b(), c() 
Our tool can detect these two recursive functions, including the call chain and location.
```

All the recursions are appeared in the strongly connected components (SCCs)ï¼Œthis tool can locate the entry APIs which lead to the SCCs.
Each SCC has stack overflow risks and needs to verify.

Now we have used this tool to find all the problematic recursive functions in those stack overflow CVEs, including:

* CVE-2018-20993:  Uncontrolled recursion leads to abort in deserialization.
* CVE-2018-20994:  Stackoveflow when parsing malicious DNS packet.
* CVE-2019-15542:  Uncontrolled recursion leads to abort in HTML serialization.
* CVE-2019-25001:  Flaw in CBOR deserializer allows stackoveflow.
* CVE-2020-35857:  Stackoverflow when resolving additional records from MX or SRV null targets.
* CVE-2020-35857:  Stac koverflow when resolving additional records from MX or SRV null targets.
* CVE-2020-35858:  Parsing a specially crafted message can result in a stackoverflow.

## Install

**1. New a file named [rust-toolchain.toml] in the rusd root directory, then write the following lines into your [rust-toolchain.toml]**.


```
[toolchain]
channel = "nightly-2020-08-24"
components = ["rustc-dev", "llvm-tools-preview", "rust-src"]
```

This file will automatically downlod the toolcahin and components to build RustSoda tool.


**2. Run "install_rustsoda.sh" in your rusd root directory.**


The **RustSoda** tool uses a shell script called `install_rustsoda.sh` to build and install.
You have to switch into the rusd root directory and run it in your bash(Linux)/zsh(MacOS). 

## Using RustSoda

You can use this tool to detect stackoverflow vulnerability in rust crates after the installation is done. 


1. Switch into your crate directory.
2. copy the **"rust-toolchain.toml"** file into your **crate** directory.
3. run **cargo rustsoda** to find all the dangerous APIs in your Rust crates which may cause stackoverflow bugs.
4. construct the **fuzz target** manually using the APIs found by our tool.
5. run "cargo afl fuzz" to detect the stack overflow bugs in your Rust crates.
